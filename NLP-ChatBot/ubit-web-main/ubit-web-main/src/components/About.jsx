        The Karachi University today is the biggest university in the country.
        It comprises eight faculties with which all the colleges of the city are
        affiliated. B.S., M.S., M.Phil. and Ph.D. classes under five of these
        faculties Arts, Science, Pharmacy, Management and Administrative Science
        and Islamic Learning are conducted on the campus, while under the
        Faculties of Medicine, law and Education it examines the students
        admitted to their affiliated colleges. Research programmers leading to
        M.Phil and Ph.D Degree are offered under all the faculties. Spread over
        1200 acres of land, University of Karachi was established through the
        parliament as a Federal University in 1951. However, through another act
        of the parliament in 1962 its status was redefined as university of the
        province of Sindh. On 23rd October, 1950 the Karachi University Act was
        passed and after an amendment in 1951, it was enacted and Prof A. B. A
        Haleem was appointed as its first Vice Chancellor. For the first two
        years, the University of Karachi remained as an examination University
        for the affiliated colleges. In the year 1953, it started its teaching
        and research activities at two Faculties of Arts and Science. Opened
        with an initial intake of 50 students, the university is now a sprawling
        structure of 53 Departments and 20 world class and highly reputable
        Research Centers and Institutes, under eight faculties of Arts, Science,
        Islamic Studies, Pharmacy, Management and Administrative Sciences, Law,
        Education and Medicine. At present, the enrolment of regular students at
        the Campus is slightly over 41,000 (Approximately) as on 30/06/2018.
        There are over 700 teachers and more than 2100 supporting staff. The
        University in the beginning was housed in small buildings adjacent to
        the Civil Hospital. Meanwhile, due to rapid expansion, it began to be
        felt that the space in which the university was functioning was not
        enough for its needs. Moreover, the atmosphere of the congested and
        polluted area was not conducive to higher education and research. Thus,
        a plot of 1279 acres of land was acquired on the Country Club Road (now
        University Road) and on 18th January 1960 the university was shifted to
        the new campus. Thus began, a new phase in the life of the university.
        The day is still commemorated by various old students' Association and
        the University administration jointly.
